  Hello, this is Jaydeep's page for CS290. My name is Jaydeep Rotithor. <br/>

  <h3>Project Information</h3>
  <p>At the moment, I am unsure as to what my project is going to be about. I am currently thinking about having it be about containing links<br/>
  to help people in certain classes. The way it would work would be that the page would contain a list of classes, and per class, there would be <br/>
  several links to websites that can help out students that need help with the material in the classes.  As I continue to
  come up with <br/>ideas, I will post them here.</p>
